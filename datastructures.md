# Data Structures and Algorithms

## how to choose a data structure?

It is important to state that no single data structure is best for all the problems. so, we need to keep in mind multiple factors before deciding like:
- what are the operations we are going to perform
- how often they are going to be executed
- ease of use
- performance
Basically, we can choose a data structure based on our input data, and complexity. Arrays are the most used data structures, because of their simplicity and efficiency.


## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
to avoid infinite recursive calls, we can add conditions, this is the most efficient and the easiest way, it will check each time until there is a case that will stop the loop.
we can also use a base case, to ensure that the recursion will stop at some point.
