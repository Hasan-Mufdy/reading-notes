# Data Structures and Algorithms

## how to choose a data structure?

It is important to state that no single data structure is best for all the problems. so, we need to keep in mind multiple factors before deciding like:
- what are the operations we are going to perform
- how often they are going to be executed
- ease of use
- performance
Basically, we can choose a data structure based on our input data, and complexity. Arrays are the most used data structures, because of their simplicity and efficiency.
