# Unit testing:

### why is it important

Unit testing can improve the code in many ways, the most important of which is ensuring that the application will run properly, also, it will improve efficiency as the developers will be able to catch bugs faster, and it will make adding new features much faster.
It would be useful to use unit testing for laundry, I would write a test to check if the clothes are still wet, and it will ensure that anything wet will stay on the ropes.
I would also write another test to check clothes colors and separate them to groups.

 

### Readme files:

Readme files are the first thing that anyone interested in the code will see, so it will be very important because it explains the project for both creators and consumers.
So, without a readme file, anyone interested in the project will have to go through the files and read the code to be able to understand the application.

Important elements to include in the readme file:
1. Explanation of the project.
2. explanation of the code.
3. How can the application be used.
4. How can developers work on the project.
